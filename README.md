Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) developed by Chalmers as part of the CoeGSS-project.

The three DSLs are described below under DSLH, DSLD, and DSLP.

This directory is an officially released snapshot of the development at the end of the CoeGSS project (September 2018).
Further development will take place in [another repository](https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de/botta/IdrisLibs).
