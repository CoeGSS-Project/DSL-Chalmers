# DSL-Chalmers

Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) developed by Chalmers as part of the CoeGSS-project.

The three DSLs are described below under DSLH, DSLD, and DSLP.

## DSLH
DSLH = DSL for determining the structure of the simulation needed to answer a High-level question

This directory is an officially released snapshot of the development at the end of the CoeGSS project (September 2018).
Further development will take place in [another repository](https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de/botta/IdrisLibs).
